- Personal project: Daily Calories Calculator
- Project Description: This is a simple program that asks the user for their age, weight, height, and activity level, then calculates an estimate of their daily calorie needs using the Mifflin–St Jeor equation (BMR=(10×weight in kg)+(6.25×height in cm)−(5×age)+5). The program will use different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), apply mathematical operations, and format the results neatly with f-strings.
