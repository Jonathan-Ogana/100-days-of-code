# 100 Days of Code Challenge

This repository contains my daily progress as I learn Python and work towards becoming a Data Analyst.  
Each day has its own folder with notes and code.

## Progress
- [Day 1](./Day01/notes.md)(./Day01/project.md) – Setting up PyCharm and EduTools  
- [Day 2](./Day02/notes.md) – Variables and data types  
- [Day 3](./Day03/notes.md) – Control flow and if statements
