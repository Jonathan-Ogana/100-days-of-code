### Day 1: September 6, 2025
- Learnt how to output in Python using the print function
- Learnt to use string concatenation and the new line escape sequence(\n) to format strings in Python
- Learnt to use the Python input() function to collect user input within my code
- Learnt to create variables and use the len() function to get the lenght of charaters in a variable
- Learnt the rules of naming variables
- Worked on a band name generator program. <img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (114)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b3ebfb-3834-4753-9527-d0527f8c7235" />
- Personal project: Simple Username Generator
- Project Description: This program will collect a person’s first name and last name using input(), format the data with string concatenation, count the characters in the generated username with len(), and display the results nicely using print() and the newline escape sequence (\n). <img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (116)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0fba5b-34cf-4633-9bea-e6c471e1f9a9" />

### Day 2: September 7, 2025
- Learnt on data types; the primitive data types in Python: Strings, Integers, Floats, & Booleans.
- Learnt on Type error which shows when I am using the wrong data type
- Learnt on Mathematical Operations: basic operators & PEMDAS
- Learnt on nummber manipulation: flooring a number using the int() function, rounding a number using the round() function, assignment operators, & f-strings
- Worked on a tip calculator project. <img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (117)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4aed93-4071-4f9c-ab83-6513e67de87a" />
- Personal project: Daily Calories Calculator
- Project Description: This is a simple program that asks the user for their age, weight, height, and activity level, then calculates an estimate of their daily calorie needs using the Mifflin–St Jeor equation (BMR=(10×weight in kg)+(6.25×height in cm)−(5×age)+5). The program will use different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), apply mathematical operations, and format the results neatly with f-strings.
